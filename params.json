{"name":"Nyc-subway-data","tagline":"An analysis of the NYC Subway Data for a project in Udacity's Nanodegree.","body":"## Statistical Test\r\n\r\nTo compare whether there is a statistical difference in the number of entries into the NYC subway when it is raining and when it is not raining, we can use the Mann Whitney U Test. This test is non-parametric and does not assume we have normally-distributed data. By running a test of normality (scipy.stats.mstats.normal), I found that the data is not normally-distributed, so this test would be more appropriate than Welchâ€™s t-test.\r\n\r\nWe should use a two-tailed test, because we would like to consider the possibility that there could be more or less entries when it is raining compared to not raining.\r\n\r\nThe null hypothesis is that the two populations are the same.\r\n\r\nWe can reject the null hypothesis, because our p-critical value (for a two-tailed test) is < 0.05. This means that the two populations are significantly different.\r\n\r\nWe can determine from the mean number of entries that there are more people entering the subway when it is raining compared to not raining.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
