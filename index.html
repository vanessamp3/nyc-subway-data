<p>To compare whether there is a statistical difference in the number of entries into the NYC subway when it is raining and when it is not raining, we can use the Mann Whitney U Test.
This test is non-parametric and does not assume we have normally-distributed data. By running a test of normality (scipy.stats.mstats.normal), I found that the data is not
normally-distributed, so this test would be more appropriate than Welch’s t-test.</p>

<p>We should use a two-tailed test, because we would like to consider the possibility that there could be more or less entries when it is raining compared to not raining.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis is that the two populations are the same.</p>

<p>We can reject the null hypothesis, because our p-critical value (for a two-tailed test) is &lt; 0.05. This means that the two populations are significantly different.</p>

<p>We can determine from the mean number of entries that there are more people entering the subway when it is raining compared to not raining.</p>

<p>I used OLS using statsmodels for my regression model.</p>

<p>The table below outlines the features I used, whether or not I dummy coded them (because they were a categorical variable), and their coefficient (if not dummy coded) in the model.</p>

<p>I started with hour and unit, because I figured that the busiest times in the subway would be during commute hours and that certain subway stations would just be busier overall
compared to others. My R<sup>2</sup> value was 0.458836. I then decided to add a constant, and it slightly improved my R<sup>2</sup> value to 0.458883. Then I added “conds” because I presumed people ride the
subway more when weather conditions are poor, “day_week” because there are probably more riders during Mon-Fri, and finally “tempi” because more people probably ride when temperatures are colder.
