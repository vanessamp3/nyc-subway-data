<p>To compare whether there is a statistical difference in the number of entries into the NYC subway when it is raining and when it is not raining, we can use the Mann Whitney U Test. This test is non-parametric and does not assume we have normally-distributed data. By running a test of normality (scipy.stats.mstats.normal), I found that the data is not normally-distributed, so this test would be more appropriate than Welchâ€™s t-test.</p>

<p>We should use a two-tailed test, because we would like to consider the possibility that there could be more or less entries when it is raining compared to not raining.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis is that the two populations are the same.</p>

<p>We can reject the null hypothesis, because our p-critical value (for a two-tailed test) is &lt; 0.05. This means that the two populations are significantly different.</p>

<p>We can determine from the mean number of entries that there are more people entering the subway when it is raining compared to not raining.</p>
